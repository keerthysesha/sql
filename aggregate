AIM:
To create a table and perform aggregate function.

ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Open the mysql editor.
Step 2: Create the database Table.
Step 3: Insert the given data into the table.
Step 4: Write the sql query after the insertion.
Step 5: Execute the code and get the dersired output.

TABLE:
CREATE TABLE Employee (
  EmployeeID INT,
  FirstName VARCHAR(50),
  LastName VARCHAR(50),
  Department VARCHAR(50),
  Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
INSERT INTO Employee (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary) VALUES
  (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'HR', 50000.00),
  (2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'IT', 60000.00),
  (3, 'David', 'Johnson', 'HR', 55000.00),
  (4, 'Emily', 'Williams', 'Sales', 70000.00),
  (5, 'Michael', 'Brown', 'IT', 65000.00);
  
TOTAL EMPLOYEE:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees FROM Employee;
OUTPUT:

AVERAGE:
SELECT AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary FROM Employee;
OUTPUT:

MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM:
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS MaximumSalary, MIN(Salary) AS MinimumSalary FROM Employee;
OUTPUT:

TOTAL SALARY:
SELECT Department, SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary FROM Employee GROUP BY Department;
OUTPUT:

RESULT:
Thus performing aggregate function on the table has been done.
