AIM:
To implement the case,cross join,full outer join in the given sample data.

ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Open the mysql editor.
Step 2: Create the database Table.
Step 3: Insert the given data into the table.
Step 4: Write the sql query after the insertion.
Step 5: Execute the code and get the dersired output.

TABLE:
create database Student;
use Student;
create table Students(
std_id integer primary key,
std_name varchar (20),
std_age integer
);
Insert into Students (std_id,std_name,std_age) Values (1,'John',16);
Insert into Students (std_id,std_name,std_age) Values (2,'Mary',15);
Insert into Students (std_id,std_name,std_age) Values (3,'Issac',18);
Insert into Students (std_id,std_name,std_age) Values (4,'Saro',16);
create table Players(
ply_id integer primary key,
ply_name varchar (20),
ply_match integer
);
Insert into Players (ply_id,ply_name,ply_match) Values (1,'Mark',10);
Insert into Players (ply_id,ply_name,ply_match) Values (2,'Mary',5);
Insert into Players (ply_id,ply_name,ply_match) Values (3,'Lucas',8);
Insert into Players (ply_id,ply_name,ply_match) Values (4,'Saro',6);
SELECT * FROM Students;
SELECT * FROM Players;

CASE:
SELECT ply_match,
CASE
When ply_match >=8 Then 'PRO PLAYER'
else 'BEGINNER'
END AS Player
FROM Players;
OUTPUT:

CROSS JOIN:
SELECT *
FROM Students
 CROSS JOIN Players;
 OUTPUT:
 
 FULL OUTER JOIN:
 SELECT Students.std_id,Students.std_name
FROM Students
FULL JOIN Players
ON Students.std_id = Players.ply_id
OUTPUT:

RESULT:
Thus the case,cross join and full outer join has been implemented in the given sample.
